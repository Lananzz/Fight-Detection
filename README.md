# Fight-Detection
This project focuses on detecting fights in real-time using a video dataset and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). By employing optimizations such as image resizing, adaptive learning rates, and dropout, we aim to develop a highly accurate model capable of identifying violent behavior in real-time video footage from a webcam.
